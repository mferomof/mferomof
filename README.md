### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fernanda!

As a data scientist, my work is driven by a deep curiosity about data's potential to tell a story. I specialize in large-scale data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, and I love using these skills to reveal the hidden patterns and correlations within a dataset.
